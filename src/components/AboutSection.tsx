        Hiya, I&apos;m some random Finn. If I told you how many thousands of
        hours of Oxygen Not Included I have played over the years, you might be
        tempted to think two things: that I know what I&apos;m doing (I
        don&apos;t), and that I have learned the designs I use often by heart
        (I haven&apos;t).
      </p>
      <p>
        The resources, guides and builds put together by the community have
        been a huge help in learning how to piece together an acceptable
        existence for my dupes. I created this site to give back to that
        wonderful community. Officially, anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
        Really, I created this site so I don&apos;t have to repeatedly spend
        hours clicking around in YouTube videos looking for build settings and
        overlays. (But if anyone asks, tell them the community thing.)
      </p>
