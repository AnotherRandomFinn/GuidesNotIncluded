        This site is made using, and is hosted by, a commercial service (called
        Wix). Because it&apos;s easy to use and I&apos;m lazy. They reserve the
        right to put cookies on this site. (Sorry about that. The goal for the
        site is zero cookies, but I&apos;ll have to learn Wordpress or some
        such first. The problem with that being the &quot;lazy&quot; part.)

        I haven&apos;t put any cookies on this site or given the right to any
        third-parties to put cookies on this site. I do not gather data about

        As a general privacy tip: you can block some tracking, and see what
        sites are trying to track you, with the help of the browser plug-in
        Privacy Badger by the Electronic Frontier Foundation. I use it myself
        and warmly recommend it.
